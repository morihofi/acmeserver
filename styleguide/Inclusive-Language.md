# Inclusive Language Guide for ACME Server Project

## Why This is Important

Inclusive language fosters an environment of respect, dignity, and equity. It is a fundamental aspect of creating a welcoming and supportive community where everyone feels valued and included. In software development, where collaboration and communication are key, adopting inclusive language in code, documentation, and interactions can significantly impact the participation and contribution of diverse individuals.

## Gender-Neutral Language

Gender-neutral language aims to avoid bias towards any gender and recognizes the diversity of gender identities.

### Suggestions for Maintaining Gender-Neutrality

#### Avoid:

- Gendered pronouns: he, she, him, her, his, hers, etc.
- Phrases implying binary gender: "he or she", "his/hers", "(s)he". These can exclude non-binary individuals and often prioritize one gender over the other.
- Using "guys" as a catch-all term. Instead, opt for "everyone", "folks", "people", "peeps", "y'all", etc.
- Gender-specific words: "brother", "sister", "man", "woman", etc., when not referring to a specific individual.

#### Generally Acceptable:

- Specific references: Naming a particular person or character, using their chosen pronouns.
- Non-English language codes or abbreviations where "he" has a different meaning.
- Historical quotations, legal documents, or other uneditable content.
- References in languages other than English, unless proficient.

#### Recommendations for Change:

- Eliminate pronouns where possible, making statements more direct and less prone to misinterpretation.
- Utilize "singular they" for an unknown or unspecified person.
- Consider pluralization to avoid singular pronoun use. For example, "When the user finishes..." becomes "When users finish...".
- For non-persons, "it" or "one" might be suitable alternatives.

## Racially Neutral Language

Certain terms in technology, such as "blacklist" and "whitelist," can unconsciously perpetuate racial stereotypes, suggesting that black equals bad and white equals good.

### Recommendations:

- Replace "blacklist" with "blocklist" and "whitelist" with "allowlist" or other neutral terms that convey the intended meaning without racial connotations.

This guide is inspired by the practices of projects like Chromium and aims to foster an inclusive and respectful coding environment. Adopting these recommendations can contribute to a more inclusive culture within the ACME Server project and the broader tech community.
