# ACME Server
This is a proof-of-concept Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Server, fully written in Java

- Java 17 and up
- Any JDBC (and Hibernate compatible) database. Currently, H2 and MariaDB drivers are in classpath
- Proxy support for HTTP Challenge

## üèó Building
Run the following command to build this application
```bash
mvn clean package
```
then start it with
```bash
java -jar acmeserver-VERSION.jar
```

## ‚ú® Features
- Self-hosted ACME Server for use with your own CA
- Revokation support
- Mostly ACME RFC compliant
- Multiple provisioners support with own intermediate CA
  - Set expiration and key algorithm for each intermediate
  - Set expiration for each issued certificate in provisioner
  - Each provisioner has its own CRL
  - Set a domain naming restriction for each provisioner (e.g. domain must end with ".example.com")
- Built-in OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) server
- Signature check of client's requests
- Support for multiple identifier in one order
- Nonce validation (Replay protection)
- Supported challenges:
  - HTTP-01
  - DNS-01

## üìí Disclaimer
This version is not fully RFC compliant, but should work with most clients. 

## ‚úÖ Tested ACME Clients
- acme.sh (works)
- Certbot (works)

## üíª Tested Operating Systems
- Debian 11, 12
- Windows 10


## üåü Use Cases for a Self-Hosted ACME Server

A self-hosted ACME Server is a versatile solution for a variety of environments and needs. Here are some key use cases:

### Internal Networks and Intranets
Ideal for organizations needing secure SSL/TLS certificates for internal web services, without reliance on external Certificate Authorities.

### Own Certificate Authorities
Allows organizations to operate their own Certificate Authority, managing certificates efficiently with complete control over issuance processes and policies.

### Development and Testing Environments
Provides developers and test teams with a platform for generating certificates for development and testing purposes, without using real certificates or external services.

### Compliance and Security
Meets the needs of organizations with stringent security policies or compliance requirements.

### Educational and Research Institutions
Universities and research institutions can use this server to impart practical understanding of certificate management.

### Custom Certificate Policies
Supports organizations with specific requirements for SSL/TLS certificates, such as unique key lengths, algorithms, or validity periods.

### Network Devices and IoT Environments
Simplifies certificate management in networks with a multitude of devices or in IoT environments, especially when devices frequently change.

### Geographic and Network Restrictions
Ideal for regions or networks with strict internet restrictions or in isolated networks.
