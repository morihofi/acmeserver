## üìÉ About

This is a proof-of-concept Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) Server, fully written in Java

- Java 17 and up
- Any JDBC (and Hibernate compatible) database. Currently, H2 and MariaDB drivers are in classpath
- Proxy support for HTTP Challenge

## üéâ ACME Server is now one year old!
One year ago, I started this project. I'm happy to announce that this project is now one year old!
The first release candidate of version 2.0 is now out!

## ‚ö† Breaking Changes - Version 2.x
- Provisioner directory is now in /acme/provisionername/directory
- Database scheme has been complete rebuilt, please clean database before use
- Due to move of provisioner directory, the URLs to OCSP and CRL have also been moved, please regenerate your intermediate certificates by delete the corresponding entries in the keystore


## üê≥ Getting started with Docker (recommended)
1. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with `docker compose` plugin, if you haven't already
2. Create two directories called `serverdata` and `logs` in this directory
3. Copy the `settings.sample.json` into the new `serverdata` directory and rename it to `settings.json`
4. Adjust the settings, especially the `dnsName` (of your host), and the `http`/`https` ports. (Don't forget to change these also in the `docker-compose.yml`-file) You can't change these later, because they will be written into the intermediate/client certificates for finding revokation list etc. and ACME client configuration will be get broken.
5. Run `docker compose up -d` in this directory. That's all!

> You can run `docker compose logs -f` if you want to see the logs of the server. Press `Crtl`+`C` to quit

## üèó Building and running on bare metal
Run the following command to build this application
```bash
mvn clean package
```
then start it with
```bash
java -jar acmeserver-VERSION.jar
```

## ‚ú® Features
- Self-hosted ACME Server for use with your own CA
- Support for PKCS#12 (.p12) KeyStore and PKCS#11 Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
- Revokation support
- Mostly ACME RFC compliant
- Multiple provisioners support with own intermediate CA
  - Set expiration and key algorithm for each intermediate
  - Set expiration for each issued certificate in provisioner
  - Each provisioner has its own CRL (Certificate Revokation List)
  - Set a domain naming restriction for each provisioner (e.g. domain must end with ".example.com")
  - Enable wildcard support individually for each provisioner (e.g. *.example.com)
- Built-in OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) server
- Signature check of client's requests
- Support for multiple identifiers in one order (multiple domains)
- Nonce validation (Replay protection)
- Supported challenges:
  - HTTP-01
  - DNS-01

## üìí Disclaimer
This version is not fully RFC 8555 compliant, but should work with most clients. 

## ‚úÖ Tested and working ACME Clients
- [GetHttpsForFree](https://github.com/diafygi/gethttpsforfree)
- [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh)
- [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org)
- [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik)
- [win-acme](https://www.win-acme.com/)

## üíª Tested Operating Systems
- Debian 11, 12
- Windows 10
- FreeBSD 13.2

## üêõ Debug Mode
Enable debug mode by set environment variable `DEBUG` to `TRUE` or start ACME Server with `--debug`.
Do not use this in production as it disables some security mechanisms and can lead to misuse of your CA.

## üåü Use Cases for a Self-Hosted ACME Server

A self-hosted ACME Server is a versatile solution for a variety of environments and needs. Here are some key use cases:

### Internal Networks and Intranets
Ideal for organizations needing secure SSL/TLS certificates for internal web services, without reliance on external Certificate Authorities.

### Own Certificate Authorities
Allows organizations to operate their own Certificate Authority, managing certificates efficiently with complete control over issuance processes and policies.

### Development and Testing Environments
Provides developers and test teams with a platform for generating certificates for development and testing purposes, without using real certificates or external services.

### Compliance and Security
Meets the needs of organizations with stringent security policies or compliance requirements.

### Educational and Research Institutions
Universities and research institutions can use this server to impart practical understanding of certificate management.

### Custom Certificate Policies
Supports organizations with specific requirements for SSL/TLS certificates, such as unique key lengths, algorithms, or validity periods.

### Network Devices and IoT Environments
Simplifies certificate management in networks with a multitude of devices or in IoT environments, especially when devices frequently change.

### Geographic and Network Restrictions
Ideal for regions or networks with strict internet restrictions or in isolated networks.
